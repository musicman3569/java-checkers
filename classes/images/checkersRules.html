	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Checkers is played by two players.
	Each player begins the game with 12 colored discs. (Typically, one
	set of pieces is black and the other red.)</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The board consists of 64 squares,
	alternating between 32 dark and 32 light squares. It is positioned
	so that each player has a light square on the right side corner
	closest to him or her.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each player places his or her
	pieces on the 12 dark squares closest to him or her.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Black moves first. Players then
	alternate moves.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Moves are allowed only on the dark
	squares, so pieces always move diagonally. Single pieces are always
	limited to forward moves (toward the opponent).</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A piece making a non-capturing
	move (not involving a jump) may move only one square.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A piece making a capturing move (a
	jump) leaps over one of the opponent's pieces, landing in a straight
	diagonal line on the other side. Only one piece may be captured in a
	single jump; however, multiple jumps are allowed on a single turn.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When a piece is captured, it is
	removed from the board.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If a player is able to make a
	capture, there is no option -- the jump must be made. If more than
	one capture is available, the player is free to choose whichever he
	or she prefers.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When a piece reaches the furthest
	row from the player who controls that piece, it is crowned and
	becomes a king. One of the pieces which had been captured is placed
	on top of the king so that it is twice as high as a single piece.</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kings are limited to moving
	diagonally, but may move both forward and backward. (Remember that
	single pieces, i.e. non-kings, are always limited to forward moves.)</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Kings may combine jumps in several
	directions -- forward and backward -- on the same turn. Single
	pieces may shift direction diagonally during a multiple capture
	turn, but must always jump forward (toward the opponent).</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"></P>
	<LI><P>A player wins the game when the opponent cannot make a move.
	In most cases, this is because all of the opponent's pieces have
	been captured, but it could also be because all of his pieces are
	blocked in.</P>
